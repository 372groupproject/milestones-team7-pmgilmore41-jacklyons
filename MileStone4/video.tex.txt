Plans for the Video:

Because I dont feel we are quite ready to code live during the video i think we will go down the topics on the term paper
about a minute a topic tops and as we go through this we will pull up the snippet that best highlights that topic. This 
will likely just be done via a zoom meeting that we record with one screen that has all the snippets sharing. Most likely all 
the feature programs will make it in and then we move on to the main demo for the last section of time where we will scan
quickly through all the code and files before running the code and using it for a few iteration of the game. Ideally we end
after covering the main unique syntax features that rust has so people realize it is similar to what they already know with
a few key changes.
