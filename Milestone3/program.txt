In an effor to utilize the nice features of Rust in terms of memory management we want to use allocatable memory in this program that we do
not have to worry about cleaning up. To do this we will make a game that has custom structs that will represent game pieces or boards. It should
prompt us to make files for these structs with a variety of impls for each struct so the structs can have special self behavior that helps play 
the game. It would probably be fair to say the supporting files be 50-100 lines and the main being 200+ lines but much of that depends on the 
complexity of the game. If done right our demo will should off the memeory managament and the enhanced safety features that Rust has.
